# Image-Classification-using-CNN

The provided explanation is an overview of a repository dedicated to exploring deep learning techniques, particularly focusing on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Let's break it down:

Exploration into Deep Learning: This indicates that the repository is dedicated to studying and experimenting with various concepts and techniques within the field of deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training neural networks with multiple layers to learn representations of data.

Image Classification with CNNs: The main focus of the project is image classification, which is the task of assigning labels to images based on their contents. CNNs are a type of neural network architecture commonly used for image-related tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies of features.

Versatility and Insights: The project is designed to be versatile, meaning it can be applied to various datasets and scenarios, not limited to a specific domain or dataset. It aims to provide insights into the intricacies of CNNs, which refers to the detailed and complex aspects or characteristics of CNNs that contribute to their effectiveness in computer vision tasks.

Purpose: The primary goal of the project is to provide a platform for learning and experimentation in the domain of image classification with CNNs. By showcasing various techniques, methodologies, and results, it aims to help users gain a deeper understanding of CNNs and their applications in computer vision tasks.

Installing Dependencies: The initial line pip install tensorflow matplotlib installs the required libraries, namely TensorFlow and Matplotlib.

Importing Libraries: The necessary libraries are imported:

numpy for numerical operations
random for generating random numbers
matplotlib.pyplot for plotting images
tensorflow.keras for building and training the neural network model
Layers from tensorflow.keras.layers for defining the layers of the neural network
Loading Dataset: The dataset is loaded from CSV files (input.csv, labels.csv, input_test.csv, labels_test.csv). The dataset consists of images (X_train, X_test) and their corresponding labels (Y_train, Y_test).

Data Preprocessing: The data is reshaped to match the input shape expected by the CNN model. Then, the pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].

Visualizing Data: A random image from the training set is selected and displayed using Matplotlib.

Model Creation: A CNN model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API. It consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and fully connected (dense) layers with ReLU activation functions. The output layer has a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function since it's a binary classification problem (cat or dog).

Model Compilation: The model is compiled with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. Accuracy is used as the metric to monitor during training.

Model Training: The model is trained on the training data (X_train, Y_train) for a specified number of epochs and batch size.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test data (X_test, Y_test) to measure its performance in terms of loss and accuracy.

Making Predictions: A random image from the test set is selected, and the model predicts whether it's a cat or a dog. The prediction is displayed along with the image.

Future: The code demonstrates a basic image classification pipeline using CNNs. In the future, you might want to:

Experiment with different network architectures (e.g., adding more layers, changing layer sizes) to improve performance.
Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for better training.
Augment the dataset with techniques like rotation, flipping, or scaling to improve model generalization.
Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images.
Explore more advanced topics in deep learning and computer vision for more complex tasks.
